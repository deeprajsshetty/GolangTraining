## Pointers

Pointers provide a way to share data across program boundaries. Having the ability to share and reference data with a pointer provides the benefit of efficiency. There is only one copy of the data and everyone can see it changing. The cost is that anyone can change the data which can cause side effects in running programs.

## Notes

* Use pointers to share data.
* Values in Go are always pass by value.
* "Value of", what's in the box. "Address of" ( **&** ), where is the box.
* The (*) operator declares a pointer variable and the "Value that the pointer points to".

## Escape Analysis

* When a value could be referenced after the function that constructs the value returns.
* When the compiler determines a value is too large to fit on the stack.
* When the compiler doesn’t know the size of a value at compile time.
* When a value is decoupled through the use of function or interface values.

## Stack vs Heap

_"The stack is for data that needs to persist only for the lifetime of the function that constructs it, and is reclaimed without any cost when the function exits. The heap is for data that needs to persist after the function that constructs it exits, and is reclaimed by a sometimes costly garbage collection." - Ayan George

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

**Part A** Declare and initialize a variable of type int with the value of 20. Display the _address of_ and _value of_ the variable.

**Part B** Declare and initialize a pointer variable of type int that points to the last variable you just created. Display the _address of_ , _value of_ and the _value that the pointer points to_.

[Solution](https://github.com/deeprajsshetty/GolangTraining/blob/master/004-Language%20Syntax/003-Pointers/005-Exercises/001-Exercise/main.go)

### Exercise 2

Declare a struct type and create a value of this type. Declare a function that can change the value of some field in this struct type. Display the value before and after the call to your function.
